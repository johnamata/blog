title: First Blog Post! Learning React and a simple movie webapp
description: 
summary: 
---

Recently I thought of getting into web development, picking up a few skills here and there and an easy tech stack to build products I'm thinking of building later. I settled with ReactJS and NextJS. To learn this, I'll be building a simple clone of hulu.com.  It's still not finished and I hope to finish it later this month after going through a bunch of other tutorials. 

code is at: [https://github.com/youwillneverafford1bitcoin/huuluu](https://github.com/youwillneverafford1bitcoin/huuluu)

commit 1: init

- just basic readme and initial gitignore

commit 2: setup

- start project with next.js
    - $ npx create-next-app NameOfApp
        - we now have a NameOfApp directory, cd into it, and run the dev server (puts app to  http://localhost:3000) with
        - $ npm dev
        - from: https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup
        - got an error when I did **$ npx create-next-app NameOfApp**:

```
 npm ERR! Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing near '...":"3.0.0","@zeit/ncc"'
 npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
 npm ERR!     /Users/patamata/.npm/_logs/2021-07-28T08_16_02_041Z-debug.log
```
- nothing on stackoverflow and github issues helped so I tried deleting the .npm and did the command again, now it works
- page routing is supported out of the box with next.js and can be seen on /pages with index.js for example representing the index page, creating about.js would be the about page 
- delete package-lock.json and use yarn to get right packages for us
- $ yarn

commit 3: tailwind and initial build

- tried a different setup with
-  $ **npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss**
- anyhow it works and setups up everyything with tailwindcss but anyhow i deleted it and went to the docs instead to try setting it up the longer way
- add tailwind CSS to project
    - $ npm install **-D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest**
    - from: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
    - but I wanted it in yarn so I only took the bolded string
    - $ yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
    - afterwards, time to create config files (tailwind.config.js & postcss.config.js) with:
    - $ npx tailwindcss init -p
    - we're still following https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
    - w/c next is "Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production"
    - where we add to **purge:** line at tailwind.config.js file the ff:
    - purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
    - purge cleans css we wont use
    - going tangential frm the setup, we add jit to the tailwind.config.js file: **mode 'jit',**
    - back to official setup docs https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
    - we're on "Include Tailwind in your CSS" and we choose the 2nd option "Include Tailwind in your CSS"
    - we just follow it and go to styles/globals.css and replace everything with what's on the docs
- $ yarn run dev
- faced an error on sonething like missing dev, so i added dev on the scripts at package.json but there's still the error:

```
sh: next: command not found
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! syscall spawn
npm ERR! file sh
npm ERR! errno ENOENT
npm ERR! @ dev: `next dev`
npm ERR! spawn ENOENT
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! Failed at the @ dev script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
```

- so I decided to upgrade yarn with **$ yarn install** and then **$ yarn upgrade** and now it works I see http://localhost:3000/
- edited index.js page to just a <h1>let's goo</h1> to test things out and all's OK

commit 4: start setup components

- decided to work on 3 components for the page: header where the activity icons will be such as search, navbar for movie filtering, and results for movies
- created a directory for components, then made js files for the components like **header.js**, etc.
- updated next.config.js to allow images and others
