Sometimes I'm a hobbyist programmer, sometimes I moonlight as an entrepreneur.  But simply I'm yet another boring computer science grad (2018) that got lucky in crypto trading in mid-2010s and was very lucky to have met my friend Mico, from my college, Asia Pacific College, who got me to crypto mining in the early 2010s.  Anyhow, my bio isnt that exciting. Hopefully in 10 years I'll replace this with something that makes me look cool. Will I be a pro skydiver? An author? A nerd who hikes mountains on weekends? Programmer at an actually cool company? We'll see...
